# How to start learning JavaScript?
JavaScript is a universal language, which has lots of diverse applications! The
most popular application for JavaScript is likely in static web design. This
branch is rarely used nowadays, since dynamic web pages have grown a lot in
popularity the last few years and have lots of advantages over a static design.
JavaScript is also the leading language in dynamic web design, both for the
backend (server programming) and front end (client programming). The server
here is the machine sending the client the web page. The client is the device
receiving the web page.  
JavaScript goes beyond just web design though - it is used to code in almost
every branch of programming. Thanks to the latest Artificial Intelligence Trends
it even reached the [Machine Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) apps!  
Mobile development, game development, server applications, such as
[Discord Bots](https://discord.js.org) - JS makes it possible!  
So where to start?
## Node.JS
[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) - the JavaScript Engine is used almost everywhere! Both thanks to its ability to interpret JavaScript Code without having to open the Browser and due to the immense amount of easily downloadable frameworks available! The huge modularity allows simple addition, removal and general management of your apps dependencies, be it [Tensorflow.JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), [Discord.JS](https://discord.js.org) or [Vue.JS](https://v3.vuejs.org) - you can manage it all in a simple manner. Node.JS will thus likely be the core of your application and is definitely worth learning!  
Some fantastic sources include the [Node.JS Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/), which is more commonly used as a lookup table, rather than an actual guide once familiar with the general idea, [Node.JS Learn](https://nodejs.dev/learn) - a site dedicated to teaching Node.JS for beginners with basic understanding of the JavaScript language.
## JavaScript
Now that you know what executes the language you are wishing to learn, might as well learn the language, so you have something to execute! For this purpose [JavaScript Info](https://javascript.info/) - an awesome resource, is just right! You can go from top to bottom in their index and learn everything in their order. It's undoubtedly one of the best resources, but if that's still not enough, you can learn [JavaScript for the Web at W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) or [JavaScript by the Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
## What Comes Next?
What comes next highly depends on your end goal! As mentioned at the start of this little essay: everything is possible with JavaScript. Here some starting points:  
- [Mobile Apps](https://nativescript.org)
- [Modern Web Design](https://v3.vuejs.org)
- [Machine Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
- [Art & Games](https://www.babylonjs.com/)
- [Data Science/Analysis](https://d3js.org/)
- [Robotics & IoT](https://cylonjs.com/)
