# How to Start Programming?
When people want to start programming, the most challenging questions are probably: 
- 'Which language do I choose?'
- 'How should I learn?'
- 'How do I start and get better?' 
- etc.  

This guide should serve as help when starting and answer most of these questions to a satisfying extent.
## What's the goal?
People, when thinking about starting to code usually have a clear goal in mind. Some learn it for the development of games, others learn it to create breathtaking websites - to each their own. Having a goal to aim for is one of the most important parts here because it serves both as motivation and direction for your studies!  
Different applications require different theoretical foundations and exercises to get proficient at them. Most Computer Science fields share fundamental knowledge about some concepts, such as the methods of structuring and processing data, which is needed virtually everywhere. Yet, as soon as you dive into specific fields, you'll start noticing that some knowledge gets unique to a certain level. Such knowledge is rarely applicable in other Computer Science fields. To name an example - you probably won't need to know the terms [Fitness Landscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_landscape) or [Genotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype), except if you're studying Machine Learning and Neural Networks.  
For this reason, the 'How to Start'-question is divided into multiple 'How to become proficient at (x)'-questions. That way more detailed answers are possible. So, you can feel free to skip ahead to the section, that interests you the most.
## Some Computer Science Fields
### Web Development
Probably one of the most sought-after careers of our time would be Web Development. Here you learn how to create one of the billions of websites. This career path gets divided into multiple ones later on. For starters, you would simply learn the languages of the Web. Those are HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), JavaScript, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Most parts of the Web use these technologies to provide their services to the world.  
HTML defines the structure of a web page without a facade or anything mechanical going on.   
CSS defines the aesthetics of a webpage. You'd use it for coloring, alignment, and even some animations.  
JavaScript represents the mechanical part and makes sure that buttons, inputs, and interactive components work as they're supposed to.  
When delving deeper into Web Dev, you will realize that there will appear more and more opportunities and branches for you to discover!
### Game Development
This branch attracts many people since it sounds relaxing. The opposite might be closer to the truth, as Game Development - especially from a scientific or theoretical view requires a fair deal of knowledge in mathematics and physics. One of "linear algebra"'s most common applications outside of pure mathematics and physics might be Game Development! Here fundamental knowledge would include mathematics, physics and the language of your choice would probably be C++.  
This branch of Software Development requires an extraordinary amount of patience. Please note that the learning curve for Game Development, especially when you are self-taught, is quite steep. Although worry not, the results of your hard work, will not let you down.
### Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence
This field is one of the rather recently popularized topics of Computer Science. To create an Artificial Intelligence you'd require most of the common Computer Science knowledge and quite a bit of mathematics once again. Additional to linear algebra, this time, you'd need probability theory and chance and a bit of calculus, depending on what type of intelligence you are creating. ML and AI are both highly interesting topics. Both - their relatively recent discovery and the idea of creating something that will make decisions itself, contribute to that.  
Languages, which are usually used for this task nowadays are Python and JavaScript. Those languages provide a bit of assistance with the mathematical part of this subject.
### Programming of Embedded Systems
Ever seen a DIY Project for an LED-Stripe or a Smart Home? The programing of all that is what this field is all about.  
Programming on Embedded Systems is usually low-level, meaning that you are communicating directly with the Hardware. This sort of low-level communication requires a good understanding of logic.  
The programming languages, which you would use for that are the dialects of the Assembly language!
### Software Development
Lastly, I'll mention Software Development. Of course, there are a lot more fields (i.e. Cyber Security, Quantum Computing). I either don't have enough experience in those fields to make a statement or will expand on them in later versions of this document. Software Development is already a pretty general term - I'll define it as the Development of Standalone Programs for your Computer.  
There is no pre-defined language for this since it's a very general field. You can do anything ranging from a simple calculator to a complicated To-Do app with in-built Voice Recognition.
## How to Learn?
Now to the real question of this essay - how to learn the chosen field efficiently? As in every language you have to 'speak' it to get better at it. As in every science you have to learn the theory to understand what's happening! Computer Science is a bit of both. You have __languages__, which contain 'scientific' elements due to their logical character.  
So in order to advance in computer science, you have to learn the logic behind the programs, which usually are algorithms, concepts, design patterns, and good practices. The other part - the linguistic part, is trained through the learning of the vocabulary and grammar of that specific language.  
Below this paragraph, you'll find some handpicked sources for learning the language. I'll divide each source into two further subcategories: Documentation and Tutorial. The Documentation will be a detailed glossary of the available words and their meaning in that language. The Tutorial is comparable to a lecture text. It contains examples and explanations for a given important topic.

- ASM x86: [Introduction](https://www.nayuki.io/page/a-fundamental-introduction-to-x86-assembly-programming) *

\* You probably don't want to start Assembly until you're well-versed with the foundations of computer science. It's crucial to understand some theory, such as Data Structures (in particular: Stack) or how a CPU works before starting learning ASM.

As a necessary supplement for the language you also need to understand some general language-agnostic concepts in Computer Science. I arranged them in the order you should learn them:
- **Variables (Types)** / **Functions** / **Control Structures** are language-specific. Try understanding those ___first___!
- [Recursion Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)
- [Data Structures Tutorial](https://medium.com/swlh/introduction-to-data-structures-9134b7d064a6)
- *there are more, but most of them are language-specific so you'll meet them sooner or later in your language tutorial, if I have forgotten something crucial I'll come back and edit this!*
